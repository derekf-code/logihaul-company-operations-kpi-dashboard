# Freight Operations KPI Dashboard

## Overview
This project simulates an operations analytics engagement for a freight company.  
Using a simulated shipment dataset, I prepared and cleaned data in **Python (pandas)**, then built a **Tableau dashboard** to evaluate delivery performance, costs, and shipment volumes across regions and weeks.  

The project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow: data wrangling → KPI definition → visualization → insights.

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Average Delivery Delay (days)**
- **% of Shipments Delayed**
- **Cost per Mile ($)**
- **Weekly Shipment Volume**

---

## Tools Used
- **Python (pandas, jupyter)** – data cleaning & preparation  
- **Tableau Public** – dashboard development & visualization  
- **GitHub** – project hosting and documentation  

---

## Findings
- The **Northeast** region had the highest transportation cost per mile ($2.54) but the lowest delays (0.93 days), suggesting efficient but costly operations.  
- The **West** region showed the longest delays (1.17 days) and higher volatility in delivery performance, signaling operational inefficiency.  
- Shipment volumes rose steadily through July, peaking the week of July 26 across all regions.
